This is a document that will dictate how formatting is done for the project.

Functions: functions are formatted using camelCase. This means that there are:
> 1. There are **no spaces** or **underscores** within the names of the functions.
> 2. The **first letter** of each new word in the function **starts with a capital letter** (Even if it is a one letter word). 

An example:
> [ **access specifier** ] [ **type** ] this**I**s**AF**unction**N**ame**E**xample(*parameters*)

Variable names / instances of objects:
> 1. In **lowercase**. Unless it is "ID", then it is allowed to be in caps.
> 2. any **spaces are represented with** the **underscore** character "_"

Class and Namespaces:
> 1. **Start with** a **capital** letter
> 2. new **words** within the class / namespace **start with a capital letter**

Curly Brace Positioning:
> 1. Curly braces "**{ }**" that are coming after a function defiinition, class definition, namespace definition, or anything of the like, are to come on a new line:

Example

> 1. | public void thisIsAdemoFunction(*parameters*)
> 2. | {

> 3. | }
